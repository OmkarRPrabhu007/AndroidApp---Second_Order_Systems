# AndroidApp---Second_Order_Systems

This MATLAB App Designer application provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing and visualizing the response of a second-order control system in real-time. The app allows users to manipulate the parameters of a standard second-order transfer function and observe the corresponding changes in various plots and diagrams.

## Features

- **Plot of the Unit Step Response**: Visualizes the step response of the system.
- **Pole-Zero Diagram**: Displays the pole-zero map of the transfer function.
- **Bode Plot**: Shows the frequency response of the system.
- **Transfer Function Display**: Provides a clear representation of the transfer function.

## Course 
This project was completed as part of the Control Systems course at the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IIT Gandhinagar) under the guidance of [Prof. Nithin V. George](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/faculty/ee/fac-nithin).
